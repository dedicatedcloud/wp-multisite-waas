		 * - new:       This is the first time registration of a new membership. In cases like this,
		 *              we should handle the first payment with the additional fees, if they exist,
		 *              as well as setup recurring profiles, if necessary.
		 * - renewal:   This type of cart handles a membership renewal. In here, you should also check
		 *              for an auto_renew flag, to be able to set up a auto-recurring profile, if needed.
		 * - upgrade:   This cart changes the membership plan. It is the same for downgrade.
		 * - downgrade: @see upgrade.
		 * - retry:     This cart is created when a customer tries to settle a pending or failed payment.
		 * - addon:     Contains only services or packages that should be added to the membership in question.
